{`Hi Stark,

I'm Peter Parker, a full-stack developer with 5 years of experience working with the MERN stack and system design. Iâ€™ve been following xyz.com's work and was excited to see the opening for a Frontend Developer.

In my previous projects, Iâ€™ve built end-to-end applications focused on performance and user experience. Iâ€™d love the opportunity to contribute to your frontend initiatives and help improve usability, scalability, and overall experience for your users.

Would you be open to a quick conversation to explore how I can support your goals?

I've attached my resume for your reference and would be happy to share more about my work.

Best regards,
